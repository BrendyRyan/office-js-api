An interesting way to use javascript and excel together. The JS API has similar functionality to VBA. It appears that VBA has far more functionality since it has been around for so many years, however the JS API is growing and new features are being added. It's pretty neat to be able to use JS in Excel.

The tutorial was excellent.
