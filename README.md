An interesting way to use JavaScript and Excel together. The JS API has similar functionality to VBA. It appears that VBA has far more functionality since it has been around for so many years, however the JS API is growing and new features are being added. It's pretty neat to be able to use JS in Excel.

The tutorial was excellent.

I tried the Custom Functions tutorial but my version of NPM and Node are too recent so it didn't work. Just read the docs.
Also tried the React version. There were a couple errors but it worked. It's old syntax with classes but is a neat idea to try.
Also tried following the Vue tutorial to get Svelte working but couldn't get it.
The basic way is probably fine TBH. Just create straightforward functionality.
