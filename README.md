# Excel Javascript API tutorial

Learning about the MS Office JavaScript API

Completed teh initial tutorial on _Dec 28, 2021_

From this website: [Office Add-In Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/excel/)

An interesting way to use JavaScript and Excel together. The JS API has similar functionality to VBA. It appears that VBA has far more functionality since it has been around for so many years, however the JS API is growing and new features are being added. It's pretty neat to be able to use JS in Excel.

The tutorial was excellent.

Got the custom functions working on _Completed Dec 30, 2021_. Next step is try the React layout.

This article is very helpful from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58218613/which-preferred-ide-for-office-js-excel-addins). Specifically on an overview of how it works.

Completed the taskpane tutorial in React on _Jan 7 2022_

Finshed the React layout with Custom Functions and a Shared Runtime on _Jan 16, 2022_. I can use this now for future project templates, as it was difficult combining the Custom Functions and React templates into one. I would like to try the same with Create-React-App however without access to the webpack it may not be possible.
