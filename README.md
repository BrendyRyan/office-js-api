Learning about the MS Office JavaScript API

_Completed Dec 28, 2021_

From this website: [Office Add-In Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/excel/)

An interesting way to use JavaScript and Excel together. The JS API has similar functionality to VBA. It appears that VBA has far more functionality since it has been around for so many years, however the JS API is growing and new features are being added. It's pretty neat to be able to use JS in Excel.

The tutorial was excellent.

Got the custom functions working on _Completed Dec 30, 2021_. Next step is try the React layout.
